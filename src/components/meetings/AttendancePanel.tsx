/**
 * Taking the roll: one dropdown per person, and a sentence when it needs one.
 *
 * This replaced a three-state segmented control plus independent "arrived late"
 * and "left early" toggles. That shape could express more — twenty minutes late
 * AND gone before the end was one control each — and it lost anyway, because
 * four controls per row times fifteen students, on a phone, in a cold shop, is a
 * roll that does not get taken. `other` plus free text says "leaving early for
 * dentist" in one field, which is both less work and more informative than two
 * booleans ever were. migrations/0005_attendance.sql has the full argument.
 *
 * "All present" then adjust is still the interaction rather than fifteen
 * individual taps: everybody turning up is the common case, and the exceptions
 * are what a coach actually wants to spend attention on.
 */

/**
 * Present, Absent, Other — and Other last on purpose. The first two cover every

 *
 * "Not marked" is the fourth option and it earns its place: the old segmented
 * control cleared a row by tapping its current state again, and a Select has no
 * equivalent gesture. Without it, a coach who mis-taps has no way to un-mark
 * somebody. Radix forbids the empty string as an item value, hence the sentinel.
